                This is called a statement. In Javascript most statements end with a ; (semicolon)
                The computer reads the line left to right to compile code, depends on the syntax.
                 Const is short for constant value (immutable) Meaning it cannot be changed
                 Use variables related to function or JS action within code (pro-tip)
                Will help other developers read your code. Use let to re-assign variables
